# KEMRI GMD Site Backend Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to create a backend for the KEMRI Grant Management Department website to enable integration with the main KEMRI website and implement real database functionality.

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Node.js with Express.js** - For API and server-side operations
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL database for flexible content storage (alternative: MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- **Mongoose** - ODM for MongoDB interaction

### Authentication
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** - For secure API authentication
- **bcrypt** - For password hashing

### Hosting
- **Same server as main KEMRI site** - For seamless integration

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Project Setup (Week 1)
- Set up Node.js project structure
- Install dependencies
- Configure database connection
- Set up development environment

### 2. Database Design (Week 1)
Create database schemas for:
- News and opportunities
- Resources and downloads
- Department information
- Contact form submissions
- User accounts (for admin access)

### 3. API Development (Weeks 2-3)
Develop RESTful API endpoints:
- Content retrieval endpoints (GET)
- Content management endpoints (POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Search functionality (replacing current static implementation)
- Authentication endpoints
- Contact form submission handler

### 4. Admin Panel (Week 4)
- Create admin interface for content management
- Implement authentication and authorization
- Build content editor with image upload functionality

### 5. Frontend Integration (Week 5)
- Modify existing frontend to consume API data
- Replace static content with dynamic content from API
- Implement real search functionality
- Add loading states and error handling

### 6. Testing (Week 6)
- Unit testing for API endpoints
- Integration testing
- User acceptance testing
- Security testing

### 7. Deployment (Week 7)
- Configure production environment
- Set up database backups
- Deploy backend alongside current frontend
- Configure integration with main KEMRI website

## Main Integration Points with KEMRI Website

### 1. Shared Authentication
- Option to use same authentication system as main KEMRI site

### 2. Data Synchronization
- Regular sync of shared content between systems

### 3. Visual Integration
- Maintain consistent branding and UI/UX

### 4. Cross-site Search
- Enable searching across both GMD site and main KEMRI site

## Technical Requirements

### Server Requirements
- Node.js 14+ runtime
- MongoDB 4+ (or MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- 2GB+ RAM
- HTTPS certificates
- Regular backup system

### Security Considerations
- Input validation on all endpoints
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting
- Data encryption for sensitive information
- Regular security updates

## Future Enhancements
- Multilingual support (English/Swahili)
- Email notification system
- Analytics dashboard
- Advanced search with filters
- Document management system with version control
